# hello-world
My first repository for idea sharing 
This is a test to see how well this repository can work for the MM collaborative project.

I'm Emily, one of the collaborators for MM along with my friend Ella. Menstrual Mayhem is using art, politics, history, music and comedy to alleviate the global stigma around menstruation.
